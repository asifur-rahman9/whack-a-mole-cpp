# cppGraphics
A C++ OpenGL project for COMP371 that renders a whack-a-mole style game with a hammer and target cube

## Features
- 3D geometry 
- Lighting 
- Camera controls
- Arm with two levels of hierarchy (bicep + forearm)
- Basic game logic: hit the target with the arm to score points



## Structure
- `src/` — C++ source files
- `include/` — Header files
- `shaders/` — GLSL shader files


## Description
The scene shows a robotic arm that can be controlled to hit a moving target. Lighting and shading are handled with GLSL shaders. The project demonstrates graphics programming concepts like transformation matrices, normal vectors, lighting, and articulating objects.

## Teamwork
This project was done collaboratively, especially with pair programming where we both looked at the code and wrote modifications / new features together.
